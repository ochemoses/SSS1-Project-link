Components Needed:
In Proteus:

Arduino Uno (from "ARDUINO" library)

4 LEDs (any color)

4 Resistors (220 ohms each)

GND terminal

Step-by-Step Instructions:
Step 1: Open Proteus and Create a New Project
Open Proteus and click on New Project.

Give your project a name, and click Next until you reach the schematic capture stage.

Step 2: Add Components
Click on the 'P' (Pick Devices) button.

Search and add the following:

Arduino Uno R3

LED-RED (or any LED)

RES (for resistor)

GND (from Terminal Mode)

Step 3: Build the Circuit
Connect each LED anode (long leg) to digital pins 13, 12, 11, and 10 of the Arduino.

Connect a 220Î© resistor from each LED cathode (short leg) to GND.

Optionally, you can use the GND terminal from the Proteus library to connect the other ends of resistors to GND.

Circuit Mapping:

Arduino Pin	LED	Resistor to GND
D13	LED1	Yes
D12	LED2	Yes
D11	LED3	Yes
D10	LED4	Yes

Step 4: Write the Arduino Code

// LED chase using digital pins 10 to 13
int ledPins[] = {13, 12, 11, 10};  // Array to hold LED pins

void setup() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    pinMode(ledPins[i], OUTPUT);  // Set each pin as output
  }
}

void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    digitalWrite(ledPins[i], HIGH);   // Turn LED on
    delay(1000);                       // Wait
    digitalWrite(ledPins[i], LOW);    // Turn LED off
  }
}
Step 5: Upload Hex File to Proteus
Open Arduino IDE.

Copy and paste the code above in your Arduino ide.

Select Board: Arduino Uno and Port (if needed).

Click Sketch > Export Compiled Binary (this generates a .hex file).

Go back to Proteus:

Double-click the Arduino Uno.

Browse and load the .hex file into the Program File field.

Click OK.

Step 6: Run Simulation
Click the Play button in Proteus.

The 4 LEDs should light up in sequence.
